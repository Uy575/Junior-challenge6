        <p class="strongtext">  <strong> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
          in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</strong> </p>
        <p> ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
          the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äùs</p>

       <blockquote>

       <p>‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
        for a big company. This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù </blockquote></p>

        <p><blockquote class="b3 b3pera ">
         ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
         professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
         student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
         did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
         project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
         could ever have. In fact,  I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
         experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
         100% recommend! ‚Äù

           Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
           learning from their experiences was easy.
          </p>

       </strong>
       <p>
         ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
         gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
         junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
         an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù
